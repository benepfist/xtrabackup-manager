#summary An explanation of the Materialized Backups feature

= Materialized Backups =

The materialized backups feature is used to make it faster to restore the most recently taken backup snapshot for any scheduled backup task.

As outlined in the various BackupStrategies documentation, depending on timing, restoring the most recent backup could potentially involve copying a full backup snapshot to the target restore location and then applying many sets of deltas, one by one, until the most recent set of deltas available has been applied.

This process can be very time consuming, and time is often not a luxury one can afford when a system failure has occurred and a restore is needed.

When enabled, this feature simply ensures that there is always a fully materialized copy of the most recent backup available to restore. This essentially means that restoring is almost entirely a case of just copying the data to the desired location.

The system works in an intelligent manner and will only use additional disk space when necessary. 

For example, if XtraBackup Manager had just completed taking a full backup, no additional snapshot copy would be made because if a restore was required, the full backup itself could just be copied without any extra work.

On the other hand, if the system had just completed taking its first incremental backup after a full backup, it would copy the full backup to a location in the configured Storage Volume and then apply the deltas for the incremental that was just taken. In this case, if a restore was required, there is no time wasted applying deltas -- the materialized snapshot can simply be copied to the target restore location and used from there.

The materialized backups feature is available on both the [ContinuousIncrementalBackupStrategy Continuous Incremental] & [RotatingBackupStrategy Rotating Sets of Incrementals] backup strategies. It is enabled by default and is controlled by the `maintain_materialized_copy` parameter.
